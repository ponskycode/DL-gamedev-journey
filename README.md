Dimensional Labirynth is a 3D game written from scratch, heavily inspired by 1993 DOOM.
Created as part of a roguelike game dev programming class as a final project. Though it is overly ambitious as we were supposed to write a 2D game.
Made using pygame.
\
\
The game is structured like a simplified dungeon crawler. You walk around, defeat various enemies searching for a portal to the next level.
\
\
It is mostly unfinished, having only basic functionalities like semi-3D graphics, movement system, pathfinding for enemies and real-time fighting system.
