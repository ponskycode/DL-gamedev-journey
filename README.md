# Dimensional Labirynth

From the day You were born You loved adventure. Where dangerous things scared others, all You felt was excitement. When You were a kid it wasn't hard to satisfy Your hunger for adventure, however as the years went past You were burdened with expectations. While trying not to collapse under them You went out into the world seeking what was expected of You. Over the years however You had enough, Your hunger for adventure awakened and so one day You heard a rumor. In one of the abandoned buildings around the edge of town You currently reside in, there appeared seemingly out of nowhere a strange staircase. Deciding to gather some simple gear, You went out to explore where it leads to...

## Shortly about

CHANGE THIS, NOT FULLY CORRECT 

As a player you start off with a character entering a 'dimensional dungeon'- meaning every level of the dungeon is a dimension of its own, that's why it can have it's very own 'unique' rules. You enter with some basic things like a backpack, oil lantern, some kind of weapon, food and water and such. You walk through various rooms and corridors with semi-random shapes and random layout. Inside the rooms there can be enemies, furniture, plethora of random items arranged in a semi-random way. When you exit the room with the entrance, the entrancedisappears. Depending on what you do there are ways to enter specific levels with a somewhat significant chance to end up at a random level (Backrooms inspired). As you defeat enemies and find items you can get a lot of various things from a piece of string or cloth to weapons and trinkets working in unexpected ways. You can get permanent buffs and debuffs in a plethora of ways. Usage of some of the items can be dependent on them. Your main purpose is to find the exit to at least a habitable dimension, if you can survive...

## Main elements

- [ ] DOOM-like style
- [ ] First person 3D view
- [ ] Takes typical roguelike dungeon crawler as basis
- [ ] Story from the perspective of one player character
- [ ] Permadeath
- [ ] First person view
- [ ] Levels are basically a bunch of connected rooms and corridors
- [ ] Grid based square/hexagonal map during exploration of the rooms
- [ ] Enemies identical to the player, but unintelligent
- [ ] Equipment system with strict rules

## Secondary elements

- [ ] Each level has a unique rule that is semi-random
- [ ] Items, buffs and debuffs interact with surroundings and other items and buffs/debuffs
- [ ] Victorian era design graphics would be nice, but any are welcome
- [ ] The number of levels one has to go through to reah a habitable one is completely random

## Ideas that might be implemented

- [ ] Backpack can be filled in volume and the character has limited weigth limit
- [ ] When weigth reaches certain tresholds, you get certain debuffs
- [ ] Level archetypes, such as: hell, danger, treasury, mystical, neutral, safe, escapable (has an 'exit' of the dungeon) etc
- [ ] Some levels have weak floor that can break underneath you and if it does, you fall into some more hostile levels
- [ ] Items that can bring you into certain archetypes of levels

# To Do

## Simple art

- [ ] 1-Two types of enemies (close and long range), including attack, death, idle, pain and walk animations
- [ ] 2-Four types of walls (for ex. dirt, rock, bricks and some kind of panels)
- [ ] 3-Two sky boxes
- [ ] 4-Two floor boxes
- [ ] 5-Animated candle stands and fires
- [ ] 6-Chest, box, drawer (static sprites, later added interaction)
- [ ] 7-Two weapon sprites (close and long range)
- [ ] 8-Three health level overlays
- [ ] 9-Mental meter for the down-left corner (just three animated/static sprites changing in relation to health/mentality)

## Map generation

1. Map 210x210
2. Divide into 21x21 spaces
3. In the middle of each space generate a room between 5x5 and 15x15
4. Randomly generate corridors between spaces in S shapes, drawing a single line through the whole map
5. Randomly throw in a couple of additional corridors
6. Generate encounters in the rooms
7. Randomly choose a boss room
8. Throw the player into a random room and empty it of encounters
